# Hello there 👋

I am **Christos Bouronikos**, a PhD student at the **University of Thessaly**.  
My doctoral research focuses on **how people with visual impairment perceive and navigate space**, using  
**EEG recordings**, advanced **signal processing**, and **machine learning** methods.

I care deeply about **accessibility** and **digital accessibility**, and I aim for my research, tools, and data  
workflows to support more inclusive technologies and environments for people with disabilities.

I hold a **BSc in theoretical Mathematics** and an **MSc in Applied Informatics** from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering of the University of Thessaly.

My work as a researcher is at the intersection of:

- EEG signal processing and time–frequency analysis  
- Spatial cognition and navigation in visually impaired populations 
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning for neural data
- Accessibility, digital accessibility, assistive technology, and inclusive design

## Research interests

- Neural correlates of spatial perception, mental mapping, and navigation in visual impairment  
- Neural markers of navigation, attention, and cognitive load  
- EEG methodology: preprocessing, artifact correction, time-frequency analysis, connectivity, and feature engineering  
- Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for EEG and other physiological time series  
- Quantifying cognitive load, attention, and task demands in realistic environments  
- Accessible experimental design, inclusive human-computer interaction, digital accessibility, and assistive technologies  
- Open, reproducible, and well documented research workflows in computational neuroscience

## Tools & skills

- **Programming & analysis:** Python, R, MATLAB, SQL  
- **Scientific computing:** NumPy, SciPy,pandas, scikit-learn, MNE-Python  
- **Data & visualization:** ggplot2, matplotlib
